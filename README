This directory contains the bootstrap tool to estimate PSI distributions 
based on aligned RNA-Seq data (BAM/SAM files).

Currently you need to run the Perl script "BAM2tri_rd.pl" followed by 
the Python script "bootstrap_psi.py".

Two sample BAM files ("TopHat2_chr21.bam" and "STAR_chr21.bam") and a 
sample exon triplet file ("RefSeq_exon_triplet_chr21.tab") are provided 
to test the bootstrap tool. This is done by, e.g., first running 
"./BAM2tri_rd.pl RefSeq_exon_triplet_chr21.tab TopHat2_chr21.bam" and 
then run "./bootstrap_psi.py".
