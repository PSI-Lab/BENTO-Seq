This directory contains the bootstrap tool to estimate PSI distributions 
based on aligned RNA-Seq data (BAM/SAM files). The updated version 
works for all major types of AS events.

You need to run the Perl script "BAM2event_RD.pl" followed by a Python
script (to be written by Hui & Hannes). 

Two sample BAM files ("TopHat2_chr21.bam" and "STAR_chr21.bam") and a 
sample event specfication file ("events_chr21.tab") are provided to test 
the bootstrap tool. This is done by, e.g., first running 
"./BAM2event_RD.pl events_chr21.tab TopHat2_chr21.bam" (which outputs 
"event_inc_exc.rd") and then the python script.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the old README for the previous version:

You need to run the Perl script "BAM2tri_rd.pl" followed by the Python 
script "bootstrap_psi.py". Two sample BAM files ("TopHat2_chr21.bam" and 
"STAR_chr21.bam") and a sample exon triplet file 
("RefSeq_exon_triplet_chr21.tab") are provided to test the bootstrap 
tool. This is done by, e.g., first running "./BAM2tri_rd.pl 
RefSeq_exon_triplet_chr21.tab TopHat2_chr21.bam" and then run 
"./bootstrap_psi.py".
